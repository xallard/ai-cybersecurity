# phishing_detector.py
# Script for detecting phishing attempts in AICybersecurity

# For the AICybersecurity project, we can develop a fictitious Python script that focuses on phishing detection. This script, possibly named phishing_detector.py, will be dedicated to analyzing and identifying phishing attempts in digital communications, such as emails or web content. This file would be aptly placed within the anomaly-detection module of the project, as phishing detection is a key aspect of identifying security anomalies.

# In this script:

# A PhishingDetector class is created with methods to load data, preprocess it, train a phishing detection model, and evaluate its performance.
# The script utilizes TfidfVectorizer for feature extraction from text and MultinomialNB, a Naive Bayes classifier suitable for text classification tasks.
# It assumes the presence of a CSV file containing text data and corresponding labels indicating whether each instance is a phishing attempt.
# The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and a classification report.
# This script, as part of the anomaly-detection module in the AICybersecurity project, would serve a crucial role in identifying and preventing phishing threats, thereby enhancing the overall cybersecurity framework.
